module.exports = `<h1>Local Drone Pilot Training</h1>
<p><img class="right" src="/images/takeoff.jpg"/>When choosing a training program, you’ll first need to consider whether you are seeking full-time employment in the UAV industry, or a part time gig. On one end of the spectrum, a hobbyist seeking to earn some cash on the weekends could take photos and video for real estate, construction, and other applications. For weekend warriors, <a href="/online-drone-classes">online drone training</a> is a convenient and affordable option, and local one-time gigs can be found using our <a href="/drone-pilot-jobs">job search</a>. On the other hand, one could go all-in and become a full-time UAV Operator or UAS Specialist in one of many growing sectors: technology, construction, entertainment, public service, and military, to name a few.</p>
<p>However, many such full-time opportunities require formal training in addition to the <a href="/part-107-test-prep">Part 107 Remote Pilot Certification</a>. In response, schools across the US have started offering high-quality Unmanned Aerial Systems degrees at all levels. Most of these schools have long histories of quality avionics education, and have expanded their programs to include UAV-specific training due to market demand. Some schools even have private airfields for training future pilots and engineers.</p>
<h2>UAV Pilot Certificate Programs</h2>
<p>When considering a certificate program, be sure you understand what the school is offering. A certificate degree, while advantageous in the marketplace, is not the same thing as an FAA-approved remote pilot certification. In general, you can expect a certificate program to cover everything you would need to know for the Part 107 Test, with additional emphasis on actual flying skills, often incorporating simulated and/or actual flight training with an experienced instructor. Most instructors are happy to continue answering questions after the course is complete.</p>
<h2>Unmanned Aerial Systems Associate Degrees</h2>
<p>An associate degree is a great option for those who have their eye on a career that requires formal training, but have limited time or finances to invest. A student at this level is likely to encounter subject material that elevates your employability to the next level - material such as technical writing, remote sensing and imagery, and basic computer science, as well as core subjects such as mathematics, English, and liberal arts.</p>
<h2>UAS Bachelor Degrees</h2>
<p>With a bachelor degree in Unmanned Aerial Systems and a few years of experience, it’s not unreasonable to expect a six figure salary. You may notice while browsing our <a href="/drone-pilot-jobs">job listings</a> that many companies prefer or outright require a four year degree. As these programs become more popular, history has shown us that the four year degree will be required for an increasing fraction of the available jobs in the field.</p>
<p>A bachelor degree in drone sciences closely resembles a traditional avionics degree, and in fact you’ll likely take classes alongside students who are training to become manned aircraft pilots. However, you’ll receive in-depth preparation in UAV-specific topics such as UAV regulations, surveillance and data processing, safe autonomous operations, and remote sensing.</p>  <h2>Graduate Degrees in Unmanned Aerial Systems</h2>  <p><img class="left" src="/images/custom.jpg"/>Many people don’t realize that masters and even PhD programs are offered in this subject. Admittedly, they’re uncommon, but this makes it a unique opportunity. If you’re considering graduate-level education in drone technology, you could probably give us a lesson or two - suffice to say, you will be at the forefront of UAV technology and innovation. Your work will influence the industry, your dissertation may result in a copyright or patent, and you will likely act as an instructor for future pilots and engineers.</p>`;
