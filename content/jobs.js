<p>It’s an exciting time in the UAV industry. The technology is mature enough that high-performance aircraft are available at increasingly affordable prices, yet the number of professional opportunities for drone pilots is growing fast. As reported by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/01/drone-pilot-school/515022/">The Atlantic</a>, the <a href="http://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/AUVSI/958c920a-7f9b-4ad2-9807-f9a4e95d1ef1/UploadedImages/New_Economic%20Report%202013%20Full.pdf">Assocation for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International</a> projected that over 100,000 new jobs for UAV pilots will be added by 2025.</p>
<p>Non-profit researcher Andrew Lacher stated for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/education/edlife/universities-offer-degrees-in-unmanned-aircraft-systems.html?mcubz=2">New York Times</a> that “It’s a rising new frontier of aviation. Just about anything you do with aviation today, you can do with unmanned aerial vehicles in the future." </p>
<p><img class="right" src="/images/construction.jpg"/>That’s a bit speculative, so let’s focus on today’s market. While military jobs still account for a substantial portion of available opportunities, technology, agriculture, and construction are driving much of the growth in both job openings and salaries. In fact, you’re likely to make twice as much your first year as a drone pilot than you would as a commercial airplane pilot (<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/business_insider/2014/09/24/drone_college_new_undergraduate_degrees_in_unmanned_aircraft_systems_pay.html">Slate - Business Insider</a>). Here are a few examples of intriguing opportunities:</p><ul><li>Agriculture: Drones are used for precision crop seeding and dusting, allowing farmers to use less pesticide while dramatically reducing the cost of flyovers (<a href="https://qz.com/61727/the-us-drone-economy-will-create-100000-jobs-say-companies-who-make-drones/">Quartz</a>).</li><li>Construction: Drones are revolutionizing the surveying, monitoring, and reporting processes of construction firms. Companies are saving tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars by switching from expensive GIS and helicopter surveys to quick, easy drone passes (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/drones-next-job-construction-work-1421769564">Wall Street Journal</a>).</li><li>Technology: Companies in Silicon Valley, Hollywood, and Seattle are hiring drone operators and lobbying the government to speed up regulation changes related to commercial UAV operation. Applications vary widely, including delivery and fulfillment, wi-fi expansion, cinematography, remote sensing, and more.</li><li>Public service: Drones are used by search and rescue, disaster recovery, and research teams to find individuals or hazards, scout dangerous areas, and to monitor the environment for research and planning purposes.</li><li>Insurance: Drones can be used to efficiently and safely collect imagery for claims adjusters. While the long-term goal of sending a drone instead of a representative has not yet been reached, many feel that this is the future of claim response protocol (<a href="http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2014/03/07/322658.htm">Insurance Journal</a>).</li><li>Real estate: Drone photography is prized by real estate brokers for several reasons: It can capture dramatic views of foreclosed homes that can’t be entered, it can offer beautiful aerial views that highlight a property’s landscape, and small drones can be used to create virtual indoor tours for prospective buyers.</li></ul><h2>UAV Pilot Salaries</h2>
<p>Salaries vary widely depending on training, experience, and specialization. A technically proficient certified pilot with a four-year UAS, avionics, or engineering degree could earn well into six figures working for Amazon Prime Air, Google’s Titan Aerospace, and Facebook’s drone initiative. If you aren’t the silicon valley type, similar salaries are available for UAV technicians at drone manufacturers like Northrup Grumman, Lockheed Martin, General Atomics, and Boeing (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/11/25/news/drone-pilot-degree/">CNN</a>). That said, an entry-level or part-time drone photographer might make as little as $30,000. A mid-level commercial pilot might earn in the $60,000 to $70,000 range, while an instructor can earn as much as $119,000 (<a href="http://www.ehow.com/info_8777905_average-salary-uav-instructor.html">eHow</a>). And then, of course, there are the military pilots. Total compensation varies depending on current bonuses and incentives, but in 2016 there were Air Force RPA pilots earning $175,000 (<a href="https://www.airforcetimes.com/articles/air-force-offers-bonuses-up-to-175-000-for-drone-pilots">Air Force Times</a>).</p>`;
